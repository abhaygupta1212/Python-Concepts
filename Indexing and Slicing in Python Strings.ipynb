    "Slicing in Python is used to extract a part of a Python string. Its syntax is  \n",
    "__string[start:stop:step]__\n",

    "__start__: it is the first index of that part of the string which is to be extracted. If no value is provided its default value is 0 if step is positive and -1 if step is negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "__step__: it is the increment value. If its value is +1, then after starting from start cursor move 1 step in the right direction, if its value is -2 the cursor move 2 steps in the left direction, if its value is +3, the cursor moves 2 steps in the forward direction. If no value of step is provided, its default value is +1.\n",

    "__stop__: it is the index which is not to be achieved. After moving the number of steps right or left as per step, the cursor stops when it reaches a point where it just needs to include or cross over the stop. The stop is never included or crossed and the cursor stops just before it. If no value is provided, the cursor will continue to move till it reaches the end.\n",

    "Indexing and slicing are powerful techniques used to access and manipulate strings in Python. With indexing, we can access individual characters of a string by specifying their position within the string. On the other hand, slicing allows us to extract a portion of a string by specifying the starting and ending positions."
